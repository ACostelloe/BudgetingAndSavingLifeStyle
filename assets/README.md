# App Icons

Place your app icons here:

- `icon.png` - 512x512 PNG for Linux
- `icon.ico` - Windows icon file
- `icon.icns` - macOS icon file

You can generate these from a single source image using tools like:
- [Electron Icon Maker](https://www.electron.build/icons)
- [Icon Generator](https://icon.kitchen/)

For now, placeholder files are included. Replace them with your custom icons before building the executable.
